        <p id="personalpara"> This is a drawing I did in my freetime of a charcater named Cyemon Kroll. He is an arrow devil which is why he has a bunch of purple and red arrows on his body. I really liked how I colored his skin with my grey. I feel it worked well and makes him pop. I mainly used different colored pens to cross hatach and hatch many times to complete him.</p>
